# OTA-Merging

This is the official repository for the paper:

**"Harnessing Optimization Dynamics for Curvature-Informed Model Merging"**

The code and instructions to reproduce our results will be released here soon.

This release contains the curvature heatmaps and FFG mask visualizations to support the main claim made in the paper.
